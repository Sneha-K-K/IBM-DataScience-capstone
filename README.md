# IBM-DataScience-capstone:Winning space race with data science
This is the capstone project of IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

SpaceX is the most successful spacecraft engineering company till date.​

The purpose of this project is to assist a new spacecraft company Space Y to compete with Space X by analyzing datasets and making predictions.​

SpaceX saves most of its money by reusing the first stage of the rocket, and therefore if we can predict if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.​

​

Considering these factors, our main goals will be :​

To understand the deterministic factors of success rate.​

To determine the success rate of landing.​
